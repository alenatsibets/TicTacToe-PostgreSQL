Welcome to the TicTacToe game! ʕ ᵔᴥᵔ ʔ 
You have 3 methods that you can use:
	- NewGame() - to initialize the game. This method returns the new game ID;
	- NextMove(game_id INT, X INT, Y INT, Val CHAR DEFAULT NULL) - to make a move. 
To this method you have to pass the game ID, line and column (move coordinates). 
You can also pass your own sign ('X' or 'O'), but this is not necessary.;
	- SeeBoard(game_id INT) - to see the board, for example after a message about an incorrect move.
 
	ʕ ᵔᴥᵔ ʔ GOOD LUCK! ʕ ᵔᴥᵔ ʔ
